<h2>Ninja Guess by Joseph Aversa</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
Ninja Guess is 2D non-jumping platformer that focuses more on minor gambling than actual action. The game can be played by yourself, with friends, or be implemented into other games as a mini game. It is a very simple game that anyone can play.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
While the game itself is very simple, it does implement several interesting technological tricks to contextualize the game mechanics. The ninja character utilizes an old-fashion sprite-sheet animation as he moves left or right. The game also utilizes if/else statements to trigger events, such as picking up an object to display a message on screen.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
The game that you will be developing will never be the game developed in your head, whether it be technical limitations or the lack of knowledge and education. The game was originally going to be an 2D action game where you fight enemies at different rounds, where you use a sword attack and a jump button. But I struggled to animate the attack and jump animation correctly, so I decided to focus a trivia game where the character would move left or right to pick up number blocks to answer math questions. However, I failed to figure out how to respawn objects in Phaser, so I finally decided to create a guessing game.

Developing the running animation was actually very simple; as long as you have patience and evenly shaped frames on the sprite-sheet. The hardest part, however, was trying to program the character to connect with the platforms and objects, which invovles different physics, attributes, and functions.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
The Assets used in this game were borrowed from diffeerent resources (one image was photoshopped to make the character move left).

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
The game was orginally going to play similarly to NES titles like "Ninja Gaiden" and "Castlevania," but ended up being similar to mid-90's edutainment games like "Mario Teaches Typing".

The actual programming of the game is structured similarly to the tutorial html files from the Phaser 2 First Game Tutorial.
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Help the young ninja defeat the guessing game up in the mountains.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
The themes implemented in this game include a mix of 90's point and click, and classic NES.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
This 2D platformer is casually played using only the left and right cursor on specific rules.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
The purpose of the prototype is utilize playable character animation and and event triggers.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
The player will have a short, pieceful, yet entertaining time as they compete with themselves (and others) in this guessing game.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
At the beginning of the game, there will be your playable character at the center of the screeen, two boxes displaying a '1' and a '0', the title, and instructions on how to play. There are two button inputs: left curser to move left, and right curser to move right. As a ninja, the character moves relatively fast, (specifically under 30 frames a second in animation at a movement of velocity = 600). To begin the game, the player just needs to move left or right. He or she is given the option to guess the number in in the system, and pick either box. The interaction with box involve methods like overTop and kill. If the player guesses correctly, he or she will receive a "YOU WIN!!!" message. But, if the player guesses incorrectly, he or she will receive a "YOU LOSE!!" message. At the end of the game, you are asked to reload the online page to play again.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Because it is a guessing game, there will be more gambling involved than actual strategy.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
The young, nameless ninja must master his training to become a master. To be an excellent ninja, he must be a quick thinker and be unbelieveable smart. He is given a task from the heavens for his training: a guessing game to test his reflexes and critcal thinking. He must continue this guessing game until he becomes a master.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
People under all ages can enjoy this game, specifically kindergardeners who are curious about the potentials of game design.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
Each game will most likely take 5 seconds to play.
